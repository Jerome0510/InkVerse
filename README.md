🖋️ InkVerse
📖 Project Overview

InkVerse is a web application dedicated to interactive storytelling.
It allows users to dive into branching narratives, where each choice directly impacts the story, the progression, and the ending.

This project is my first solo project, born from the combination of two passions:
👉 web development
👉 immersive storytelling

The main goal of InkVerse is to deliver an engaging, intuitive, and immersive experience, where technology serves the narrative.

🎯 Project Objectives

- Build an interactive reading application with narrative choices
- Offer multiple story universes and visual atmospheres
- Design a robust and scalable architecture
- Provide a smooth and immersive user experience
- Showcase a full-stack project within a Web / Web Mobile Developer training program

🧩 Key Features

- Selection of interactive stories
- Choice-based narrative progression
- User progress management
- Dynamic content and background display based on the story universe
- Interface designed to enhance narrative immersion

🛠️ Technologies Used

Front-end

- Next.js / React
- Semantic HTML
- CSS (modules or global styles)
- Dynamic content rendering

Back-end & Data

- Relational database (SQL)
- Story structure divided into steps and choices
- Relationship management between narrative entities

🎨 Design & Prototyping

The UX/UI design process was carried out upstream using Figma in order to:

- Structure the pages,
- Define user journeys,
- Ensure visual consistency across the application.

🗄️ Database Modeling

The database was designed to meet the specific needs of interactive storytelling:
stories, steps, choices, user progress, etc.

The data model was created using DrawDB to clearly visualize the relationships between the different tables.

⚠️ Production Constraints

During the development of this project, several constraints influenced both technical and artistic decisions:

- Limited production time
- No financial resources to hire a professional illustrator

To address these constraints, some visuals were created using image generation tools, allowing the project to maintain a strong visual identity while staying within scope.

🚀 Future Improvements

- Addition of new stories and universes
- Advanced progress saving system
- Accessibility improvements
- Optimized mobile version
- Expanded narrative mechanics
